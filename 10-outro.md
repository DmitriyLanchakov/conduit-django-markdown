# We’re done here

Well, that’s the ballgame. 

We’ve built a new app from scratch. We’ve added authentication and authorization. We’ve made it possible for users to create and comment on articles. Users can filter based on a number of things like author and tag. Every user has their own profile. I could go on, but you were there. You remember.

The best way to learn is work on projects that are just outside your comfort zome. Hopefully, we have helped grow your comfort zone and you feel ready to take on new projects and keep learning.

If you have any questions or thoughts or recommendations or anything else, you can reach out to the Thinkster team on Twitter at [@GoThinkster](#) or in Slack if you’re a [Thinkster Pro](#) user. You can ping me directly on Twitter at [@brwr_](#) or in the Thinkster Slack channel at [@james](#).

Good luck on your journey. I hope you go far.

James
